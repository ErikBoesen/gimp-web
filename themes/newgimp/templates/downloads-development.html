        <h2>GIMP (development version) for Unix-like systems</h2>

        <p>It's very likely your Unix-like system such as a GNU/Linux distribution already comes with a GIMP package. It is a preferred method of installing GIMP, as the distribution maintainers take care of all the dependencies and bug fix updates. Please note that many distros decide to pin a specific version of GIMP to their releases.</p>

        <p>
            GIMP can also run on Solaris and is available for the BSD family of systems such as FreeBSD and OpenBSD.
        </p>

        <p>
            Please refer to the documentation for your Unix-like system on the installation of software.
        </p>

	<p>
	  Most Unix-like systems make it very easy to install a development environment for building software from source. If you can't find a GIMP package in your distribution's package repository or want to build a more recent GIMP version that what is available there, then see the <a href="#source">source code section</a>.
