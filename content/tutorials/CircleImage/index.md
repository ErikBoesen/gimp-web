Summary: How to create a circular-shaped image.

Making a circle-shaped image
============================

There are no circular images. There are only rectangular images. 
But there can be images where corners are transparent, so that only a circle shows.

In light of this:

* First, make sure that your layer has an "alpha channel".  
    <div class='MenuCmd'><span>Layer → Transparency → Add alpha channel</span></div>
    if it's grayed out it means you already have one
    <figure><img src='add-alpha.png' alt='GIMP Add Alpha Channel Dialog'></figure>

* Create a circular selection with the "Ellipse select tool" (the 2nd one in the toolbox). 
    <figure><img src='ellipse.png' alt='GIMP Ellipse Select Tool'></figure>
    Use the "Tool options" dialog  
    <div class="MenuCmd"><span>Windows → Dockable dialogs → Tool options</span></div>
    <figure><img src='tool-options.png' alt='GIMP Tool Options'></figure>
    * If you want a true circle, use the *Fixed* option: select *Aspect ratio* and enter `1:1`. 
    * Depending on what kind of marks you have, you can use: 
        * The diagonal framing (default): click on one corner, drag across a full diagonal and release at the opposite corner, 
        * The radial framing (check *Expand from center* in the Tool options): click on the center, drag across a half diagonal release on a corner.

* If the selection isn't perfect on the first try, you can move it (click around the middle) or extend it (click inside, near a border or a corner).

* Once you have the required selection, invert the selection (*Select&nbsp;→&nbsp;Invert*, or Ctrl-I) so that everything is selected, except your circle.

* Erase the selection (*Edit&nbsp;→&nbsp;Clear* or [Delete] key). You should have your central circle left, surrounded by a checkerboard pattern. 
(this checkerboard is not part of the image, it just indicates the transparent parts of the image).

* You can reduce the checkerboard to the minimum by auto-cropping the image (*Image&nbsp;→&nbsp;Autocrop image*)

* Last, save the image in a format that supports transparency, like PNG (JPEG doesn't support transparent images...)

* If you are going to work further on the picture, save it as XCF (Gimp native format).
