Summary: GIMP 2.10 RC1: bugfixes, stability and polish
Status: draft

Newly released GIMP 2.10 RC1 is the first release candidate before GIMP
2.10 stable release. With more than 725 commits since the 2.9.8
development release mid-December, for an average of 7 commits a day, the
focus has really been on getting the last details right.

We actually got a few fancy new features, and in particular a new
Dashboard dock to display GEGL cache, swap size and CPU usage, as well
as a new debugging dialog which appears upon crashes or various critical
errors, encouraging you to report bugs, hence helping us to improve GIMP
even faster!
As you can see, even new features are mostly targetted at efficiency and
debugging.

For a complete list of changes please see [NEWS](https://git.gnome.org/browse/gimp/tree/NEWS).
